  <p> This was a really nice album to start this journey with,
  <p> It evokes some similar feelings of early
  <p> Jan Jelinek / Farben records.
  <p> Most of the songs are unforgettably swung,
  <p> Full of pittering hi-hats and filters,
  <p> modulated with LFO's synced to the off beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> This style ( washy envelopy rusty and blanketting ),
  <p> Is quite hard to get just right.
  <p> The balance of warm melodic elements
  <p> With repeating, undulating, metallic scrapes
  <p> Feels quite nice on the ears.
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> This is my first real attentive listen
  <p> To any of Dauwd's discography - surely 
  <p> they are on my list to follow closely now.
