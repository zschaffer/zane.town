  <p>Welcome,</p>
  <p>I've not much to say here - This is my home on the internet. A place I feel comfortable rearranging and styling,
    thousands of times over. Feel free to explore my home, reach out for a chat, or send me an email.</p>
  <p>As for me, myself, and I? My background is in music and technology - lately more the latter. Find out more <a
      href="#now">here</a> and <a href="#music">here</a>.</p>
  <p>You can reach me slowly via <a href="mailto:mail@zane.town">my email inbox</a> or by PRIVMSG'ing zane on <a
      href="https://tilde.chat">irc.tilde.chat</a>. </p>

  <p>I am currently learning more about embedded systems,
    how they interact, and how they communicate inside.
    I've been focusing on <a href="https://github.com/zschaffer/wax.git">making things in C/C++</a>
    reading endless manpages and tinkering with SBC's.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I've lost the motivation and free time to create and lately I only listen.
    To make up for this - I'm starting to curate a reviewed
    and detailed listing of what I'm playing.</p>

<section id="music">
  <p>I don't make much music these days.. Yet I try to stay active in other ways. For instance, you can find me
    streaming music live,
    Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 11:00am PST at <a href="https://tilderadio.org">tilderadio</a>.</p>
  <p>You can find archives of my live streams <a href="archive">here</a>.</p>
  <p>My released music lives on
